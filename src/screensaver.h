/*
 * screensaver — full-screen idle takeover with a pool of theme-tinting
 * painters.
 *
 * Wired into the menu loops via screensaver_check_idle() — call when
 * input_poll() returned PK_NONE. Internally checks the idle threshold
 * against input_last_input_ms() and, if exceeded, picks a painter from
 * the pool and runs it full-screen until any keypress arrives. The
 * triggering keypress is consumed (not surfaced to the menu) so the
 * user doesn't accidentally launch a feature on wake.
 *
 * Pool (all theme-tinting via T_FG / T_ACCENT / T_ACCENT2 / T_DIM):
 *   0  WARDRIVE       — fake AP scroll, channel hop, PMKID flash, packet streaks
 *   1  MATRIX RAIN    — full-screen phosphor cascade
 *   2  BREATHING      — POSEIDON wordmark fade-in/out, drifts to prevent burn-in
 *   3  DEEP SCAN      — sonar pulse from center, named contacts blip in/out
 *   4  PORT SCAN      — vertical port grid 0-65535, scanning beam, open/closed flashes
 *   5  HEX CASCADE    — falling hex bytes with occasional decoded ASCII reveals
 *   6  TERMINAL CRACK — fake hashcat / john output streaming, periodic CRACKED flash
 *   7  NEURAL ARC     — pulsing dot mesh with electric arcs jumping between nodes
 *   8  GLITCH BSOD    — periodic full-screen text glitches with chromatic shake
 *   9  TIDE WAVES     — overlapping sine waves drifting across the screen
 *
 * Pick mode: -1 (SHUFFLE) picks randomly from the pool excluding the last-shown
 * one (persists across reboots in NVS); >=0 locks to that specific painter.
 *
 * NVS namespace "pscr": enabled (bool, default true), timeoutms (uint32,
 * default 120000), pick (int8, default -1 = SHUFFLE), last (int8, last
 * actually-run index — used to exclude in shuffle mode).
